Recipe Page ðŸŒŸ
 
A recipe page using basic HTML.

The very first project of the Odin Project have immensely helped me to apply all the tags and elements I have learned so far. While working on the project I was able to create lists and also nested lists with the understanding of when to use them. Also I was able to write a clean and simple code which is apparent to any viewer.
